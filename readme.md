# Guide on implementing OpenTelemetry in Python Applications

OpenTelemetry is an an open-source observability framework that aims to standardize the generation, collection, and management of telemetry data(Logs, metrics, and traces). It is incubated under Cloud Native Computing Foundation(Cloud Native Computing Foundation), the same foundation which incubated Kubernetes.

OpenTelemetry is quietly becoming the default standard for generating, transmitting and managing observability data and new-age companies are embracing it for future-proof instrumentation of their applications.

In this guide, you will learn how to implement OpenTelemetry in Python Applications. Following lessons cover everything you need to know about using OpenTelemetry to implement observability.
